            <h2>Here's a time line of Sir Galileo Galilei</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span>1564</span> - Born in Pisa, Italy.</li>
                <li><span>1581</span> - Entered the University of Pisa at age 16 to study medicine, but was soon sidetracked by mathematics.</li>
                <li><span>1583</span> - Made his first important discovery, describing the rules that govern the motion of pendulums.</li>
                <li><span>1609</span> - Built his first telescope.</li>
                <li><span>1610</span> - Discovered four new “stars” orbiting Jupiter—the planet’s four largest moons.</li>
                <li><span>1614</span> - Was accused of heresy for his support of the Copernican theory that the sun was at the centre of the solar system. This was revolutionary at a time when most people believed the Earth was in this central position.</li>
                <li><span>1616</span> - Was forbidden by the church from teaching or advocating these theories.</li>
                <li><span>1632</span> - Published his “Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,” which supposedly presented arguments for both sides of the heliocentrism debate. His attempt at balance fooled no one.</li>
                <li><span>1633</span> - Was summoned to appear before the Inquisition in Rome. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, later reduced to permanent house arrest at his villa in Arcetri, south of Florence. He was also forced to publicly withdraw his support for Copernican theory.</li>
                <li><span>1642</span> - Died n Arcetri near Florence, Italy at age 77.</li>
            </ul>
