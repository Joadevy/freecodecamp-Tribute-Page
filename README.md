## Overview
This is my solution to the [Tribute page from freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). 

### The challenge

- This is the 1/5 challenge of the Responsive Web Certification from freecodecamp. Basically consist on create a tribute page for somebody aplying the knowledge adquired on the course. Then I had some requirements to follow in the development process and I have tested all of it.

## My process

### Built with

- Desktop workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS for nesting, module and custom properties
- Control version system using Git

### What I learned

This is my first project for this certifaction and I felt comfortable doing it. 
I used SASS to nesting and partials in order to module my code. I used a pattern to organize the project like an architecture but adapted for this small web.
I learned more about code reutilization, I used it with the articles of the page. I learned a little bit of design also and I like it and I used git for first time after I had learned and it was really cool.
I'll keep working on it.

### Continued development

I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially about going into javascript in order to create dynamic webs, I'll work on that when I feel confortable with my HTML/CSS skills. I'll keep learning git too because it's important and useful tool for co-working.
